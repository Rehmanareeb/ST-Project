# About

## Info:
This website is a basic template website that is built for carrying out our Project of Software Testing.

## Type of Testing Being Performed:
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components of the application to ensure they work as expected.
- **Integration Testing**: Verifying that different modules or services used by the application interact correctly.
- **Functional Testing**: Ensuring the application meets the specified functional requirements.
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluating the responsiveness, stability, and scalability of the application under a particular workload.

## Tools Being Used for Testing:
- **Pytest**: A testing framework for writing and running unit and integration tests.
- **Selenium**: For automated browser testing to verify the user interface and interactions.
- **Postman**: For API testing to ensure endpoints behave as expected.
- **Locust**: For performance and load testing.

## Testing Techniques:
- **Black-Box Testing**: Testing without knowledge of the internal code structure, focusing on inputs and outputs.
- **White-Box Testing**: Testing with knowledge of the internal workings of the application, ensuring code paths are executed correctly.
- **Regression Testing**: Re-running tests after changes to ensure no new bugs are introduced.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Ad-hoc testing to discover unexpected issues or edge cases.
